I hope to develop a strong base of technical skills in AI that I can build on as I complete future projects. I am also excited to develop career skills which will help me find internships and jobs in the future.

From Dr. Kong's presentation, I learned that I do, in fact, have a unique story to tell and that by telling my story I can change the world in my own way. I also learned how to envigorate my stories to better capture the attention of my audience. This will be especially useful if I need to persude my audience to support a certain cause. In addition, it was great to hear the stories of people who attended one of Dr. Kong's workshops and how learning how to properly tell their story impacted their journey.

i. With supervised learning, we know the output values and the goal is to find the path from input to output. With unsupervised learning, we do not know the output values and have to predict the patterns based on the unlabeled data
ii. The statement Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries is false. Scikit-learn is a package that uses data analysis libraries like Graphviz and Pandas to visualize data.

Identifying and treating different types of cancers can be a difficult task for doctors depending on the location of tumors and stage of progression. I found a dataset with segmented liver images with digestive cancer. By training a ML model to recognize digestive cancer, doctors can use less invasive procedures for diagnosis.
